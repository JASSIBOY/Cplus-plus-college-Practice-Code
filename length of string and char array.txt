1) In string
      string str;
      in this part string is an object;
      we can't the use of strlen() for the size of string. 
there is a type of find the length of string given:
   string length==str.size();//it is right.

that's we can never write ...that type 
  string length==strlen(str);//it is wrong.

2) in char array
       char arr[1000];
the size of char array is given below :
 length of char array=strlen(arr);//it is right. 
   length of char array=arr.size();//it is wrong.
